# Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard remappings

The mappings are based on a [Reddit
comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/kinesisadvantage/comments/jyjww1/share_some_of_your_configurations/gdgqx4x/).
I am not sure yet whether I will stick with this mapping, but it has the benefit
of moving some frequently-used keys from the pinkies.
